Rohit Sharma | Man of the match: It was an important game, a decider," and we wanted to just enjoy ourselves. To keep that Australian batting line-up to less than 290 was impressive. Once KL got out, we knew we needed to stitch together a big partnership, and no better person than the captain himself to do that. It was important to get that partnership from the team's perspective. We had that talk in the middle - one of the two of us needs to continue, and we couldn't lose the momentum, especially after the 100-run stand. I was middling and seeing it well, so I said I wanted to play my shots, and take the risks. It came off today, but if we had lost wickets, things would be different. Australia always comes up with good bowling attacks. Their top three quick bowlers challenge you, they've got variety and skills. In the first two games I was trying something different and it didn't come off. Today I just wanted to be there till the end, around the 35th over, and I was trying to push the run-rate forward because I was seeing it really well, but it didn't come off because I miscued one."

17:15 Local Time, 11:45 GMT," 17:15 IST: Great comeback from India - Australia lost their last 6 wickets for 51 runs. Australia were well set for a score in excess of 310-320, but Shami led the way for the hosts with a great exhibition of yorkers, Bumrah kept a tight lid as well. Shami started it all with a brilliant delivery to get rid of Warner. Finch then fumed at Smith for misleading him. And then Smith put his head down for a toil. His literal brother (Labuschagne) joined the party as well and the duo added 127 for the third wicket. The Starc experiment ended with him getting a bronze duck, but Carey came out attacking and the runs started to flow. Kuldeep got him when India badly needed a breakthrough. Smith got his 9th hundred and played audacious strokes, but the Indian pacers managed to pull things back. The surface was definitely holding in the initial phase of the innings, but batting seemed to get better with time. Spinners did get some turn, but the evening Luru moisture could well make the ball skid onto the bat. Interesting chase on the other side. Join us in 30..."

20:24 Local Time, 14:54 GMT," 20:24 IST: An extremely one-sided contest and the Aussies are 1-0 up in this three-match ODI series. 255 was below-par but the way the visiting openers batted, I doubt if even 320-330 would have made any difference. India's bowlers lacked discipline and were mauled around by a determined Warner-Finch pair, both of them cruising to unbeaten tons. The Aussie skipper was the aggressor initially, allowing Warner to take his time but once the latter got set, runs bled from both ends. The scoring rate was ultra-rapid and it's safe to say that the game was virtually over inside the first 15-20 overs itself. India's batsmen weren't good enough earlier in the afternoon, but you have to credit Australia's bowlers, the spinners in particular. Australia now have won four ODIs in a row in India against India. They are starting to have a mental edge over Kohli's men."

17:16 Local Time, 11:46 GMT," 17:16 IST: A disciplined performance from the Aussies after winning the toss. Dhawan and Rahul did set things up for India with a steady partnership but the visitors never allowed the duo to get off the hook in terms of the scoring rate. Once the stand was broken, wickets started to fall in bunches, thereby robbing India of the momentum they were seeking. Pant and Jadeja threatened briefly but once again, the Australians struck at the right periods. The lower order chanced their arms to get the score past the 250-run mark which is respectable but doesn't look like a par score at this point of time. It was a collective bowling performance from the Aussies with everyone chipping in. Advantage Australia as we head into the break but if the dew doesn't set in early, you never know. Back shortly."

19:02 Local Time, 18:02 GMT," 23:32 IST: After the timid finish yesterday at Edgbaston, we certainly have had one heck of a contest here at Chester-le-Street. 338 was always a stiff target on this slightly two-paced surface and at 84/4 in the 18th over, West Indies' innings was going nowhere. That's when the ever impressive Pooran started to kickstart the resurgence, initially with a partnership with Holder before Allen produced a blistering fifty to turn the tables a fraction. With the left-arm spinner giving company to Pooran, West Indies were looking favorites but as it happened many-a-time in this tournament, a brain fade moment destroyed things. Allen was run out and while Pooran took it deep, he was removed by Mathews who made his first over in 18 months a special one. West Indies would rue some really basic errors that refuse to let go of them. Malinga and de Silva were good for Sri Lanka whose bowlers wilted under pressure a bit, with the fielding also going downhill over the final hour. In the end, they did enough to get over the line."
Mathews to Cottrell, no run," SL prevail in this well-fought contest! Slower ball outside off, Cottrell punches off the back foot but picks out extra cover"

Got lucky eventually"

Thisara didn't pick it properly and eventually, let it slip"
Lasith Malinga [8.0-0-47-2] is back into the attack, FOUR," Thisara has made a royal mess at long-off!! Misjudged the catch totally, overran it and eventually, fingeripped over his head to the fence.

If it was Fernando earlier on in the day, it's this dashing West Indian's turn to show that there are some promising talents in these two countries. Pooran has been good for a major part of the tournament to be honest and a big knock was on the cards. Reaches the milestone with a flick through mid-wicket, runs hard to get a brace.

14:29 Local Time, 13:29 GMT," 18:59 IST: A fine batting effort from Sri Lanka after being put in on a surface that looked alright to bat on but also had the slower balls gripping a bit as the innings progressed. After threatening with eye-catching cameos, young Fernando finally delivered what he had promised, a captivating century, his first in ODIs and that was the cornerstone of the Lankans' batting performance. His fluidity and solid nature allowed the likes of Mathews and Thirimanne to blitz cameos at the other end to ensure an above-par total. A good start by the openers set it up, driven by a Perera fifty but both of them, as well as Mendis were guilty of throwing away their starts. Fernando didn't though, and put on an exhibition out there. West Indies weren't consistent with the ball, particularly early on and if not for the trio of Thomas, Cottrell and Allen, the score could have been much more. West Indies have a task on their hands but they also have some destructive batsmen who would definitely swing from the outset. Can they make this game interesting? We'll soon find out. Back shortly for the run chase."

18:32 Local Time, 17:32 GMT," 23:02 IST: A lady - Charulata Patel - who is 87 years young and a die hard Indian team fan was out there to congratulate the players. Virat Kohli went over and spoke to her. Speaks volumes of what this tournament means to her and the entire Indian contingent. India have done it again to Bangladesh. Knocked them out in 2015 WC and have delivered the killer blow again. This after Bangladesh had dented India badly in the 2007 WC. Back then, they might not have been favorites but today they went neck and neck against every Indian move barring the opening partnership. But once the 180-run partnership was broken Bangladesh clawed back a lot of distance. It was light-years turning into mere metres. India were easily 30 short thanks to their meltdown in the last 20 overs. The Fizz ended up with a fifer to be the wrecker-in-chief. 315 and Bangladesh had a fair shout at it. Few felt it would be a squeak. And Bangladesh never let India breathe easy."

Amir to Shakib, no run," fuller and straighter this time, Shakib shuffles across and blocks it out"
Amir to Shakib, no run, slash and a miss! On a good length with a hint of extra bounce as Shakib goes hard on the cut stroke. Probably went too hard at it and also got hustled

Hafeez to Shakib, 1 run," very full and around middle, Shakib jams it out towards mid-on"

Amir might be the unluckiest bowler going around, if we take the count of dropped catches off his bowling in recent years.

14:22 Local Time, 13:22 GMT," 18:52 IST: Okay! So, here it is: Pakistan need to bowl Bangladesh out for seven runs to displace New Zealand out of the semi-final race. Most Pakistan fans would have expected a better batting show from their team, but in fairness this wasn't a track where you could score easily and get to 400, clearly exemplified by the approach of Pakistan openers. Should they have gone crazy in the first 10 overs? Maybe. Maybe not considering the slightly two-paced conditions. After Fakhar's departure, Imam and Babar kept the scorecard ticking with a positive approach whilst finding timely boundaries at will. The latter looked set for a hundred, but a slightly hurried approach cost him his wicket and Pakistan had to play a bit of catch-up from there. Imam did get to a memorable maiden World Cup ton, but he got out soon after scoring the hundred and that clearly dented Pakistan's hopes of scoring big. With no set batsman in the final few overs, Imad battled against the short ball barrage and his own fast-growing fame of a more-than-a-handy batter to offer Pakistan the tiniest nibble at reaching the semis. What's in store in the second innings? We will soon find out. Back in 25..."

9:00 local, 8:00 GMT," 13:30 IST: You generally feel sad when your favourite TV series is about to end. After all, they've given you a lot of entertainment and farewells are never pleasant. The 2019 World Cup is almost at the verge of bidding adieu to a soap opera of its own. Don't get me? I'm talking about The tales of 1992, the huge blockbuster series that took shape after Pakistan had a game washed out and since then, there have so many coincidences for them with regard to their victorious 1992 campaign that it seemed like it was destiny. Unfortunately, we'll have to witness something beyond miraculous today for the sub-plot to continue. A win today will take Pakistan to 11 points, level with New Zealand but that won't do due to the massive net run rate difference between the two sides. Such is the improbable nature that they don't stand a chance if they happen to chase. Sums it up, doesn't it? "
18:00 Local Time, 17:00 GMT," 22:30 IST: Used surface. Very slow track. Sri Lanka defended 232 against England here. Only one side had chased 250+ in this World Cup. Looks like India had not heard any of that especially Rohit and Rahul. The openers went about the chase in a professional manner. Rohit gave a blazing start and Rahul was more than happy to play second fiddle. They went about smashing anything that was slightly off and milking the rest. Rohit got to his fifth hundred in this edition and in the process equalled Tendulkar's World Cup record of six.

Very slow track. Sri Lanka defended 232 against England here. Only one side had chased 250+ in this World Cup. Looks like India had not heard any of that especially Rohit and Rahul. The openers went about the chase in a professional manner. Rohit gave a blazing start and Rahul was more than happy to play second fiddle. They went about smashing anything that was slightly off and milking the rest. Rohit got to his fifth hundred in this edition and in the process equalled Tendulkar's World Cup record of six. But he soon threw it away as he has done with his last three tons, Rahul took over and got to his maiden World Cup ton. He too perished looking to finish it quickly and Pant followed him.

09:20 Local Time, 08:20 GMT," 13:50 IST: Let us now talk about form as we go deeper into the build-up. For India, it has been Rohit Sharma at the top with a good amount of varnishing being done by KL Rahul, Virat Kohli and Hardik Pandya. MS Dhoni has runs behind him, but he's been often chastised for being slow. Yet, India's batting line-up has a sense of security behind them although the likes of Kedar Jadhav, Rishabh Pant and Dinesh Karthik haven't had enough time in the middle. Jasprit Bumrah has been the go-to man with the ball and he hasn't disappointed - often setting up chances for the rest of the bowling line-up to prosper. Mohammad Shami's erratic ways in the death overs is a question and 'KulCha' haven't yet set the stage on fire. Still, with Hardik Pandya turning out to be a fine choice as a fifth option, the bowling looks to be in safe hands."
09:05 Local Time, 08:05 GMT," 13:35 IST: It's the last day of the league phase of 2019 Cricket World Cup and the race is on to grab the top-two places in the points table. As of now, New Zealand and England know their semi-final venues, irrespective of today's result. Kane Williamson's men will play their semi-final at Old Trafford while the hosts are back to Edgbaston, one of their luckiest venues over time. So, what are the odds on an Ashes rivalry at Edgbaston? That will happen only if Australia lose their final league match, against South Africa, in Old Trafford later today. On the other hand, a win will set-up a Trans-Tasman semis in Manchester with England then taking on India once again at Edgbaston. Having already set base in OT, Australia will love to continue their World Cup journey at the same venue while India might just want to spoil their plans. It's not in Kohli's hands though, win or loss, India are already through to the semis, but finishing first will give them a chance to not only play at a venue with happy recent memories but also against a team that has seen a recent slump in form. First things first though - they are up against Sri Lanka at Headingley and they need to take care of today's encounter."
21:23 Local Time, 20:23 GMT," 01:53 IST: I repeat, Australia finish second on the points table and they will face England in the semi-final. When it comes to World Cup encounters between these two sides, they're never short of action. Today you got to know why! After setting a massive first innings total, South Africa had an early advantage as they got rid of Finch and Smith. Khawaja too walked back to the pavilion due to his hamstring injury and South Africa at that point were dictating terms. However, David Warner didn't give up. His partnership along with Carey kept the run chase alive but they had too much to do. In the process, Warner also overhauled the 600-run mark in this edition of the World Cup but South Africa were clinical across all aspects of the game. Pretorius bagged two crucial wickets earlier while Rabada sealed the fate in the 49th over with his professional effort. Hang in for the presentations..."

17:06 Local Time, 16:06 GMT," 21:36 IST: It's safe to say that South Africa have turned up and arguably, put up their best batting performance in this World Cup. Better late than never, they say. The toss, it has to be said, seem to be a crucial factor as South Africa munched on the erroneous lengths from the Australian new ball bowlers to take maximum advantage of the powerplay. The game's pace only changed after the introduction of Nathan Lyon who removed both openers to provide a sniff at the vulnerable middle-order. Faf and Rassie, however, had other ideas. Both took lead roles at different stages of the innings to take their team to a really competitive total. While Faf compiled his first ton of this World Cup, Rassie missed it by a few metres. With the track proving to be a batting belter coupled with a rapid outfield, Australia will fancy their chances to finish on top of the tree. India still have a few runs to knock off against Sri Lanka and in around four hour's time, we should have the confirmed semi-final fixtures. Who plays who? Back in 30 to find out the answers..."

Lyon to de Kock, 1 run," full ball at the stumps, drifting in from round the wicket, de Kock works it to mid-on. Fielder's probably not close enough to cut the single. They hustle through"

14:56 Local Time, 13:56 GMT," 19:26 IST: Take a bow, New Zealand. They were under severe criticism yesterday when the batsmen batted slowly or seemingly slowly, but they were reading the pitch well. Got themselves to a respectable total through some smart batting and then, the bowlers took over in helpful conditions today morning. Henry and Boult were lethal with the new ball, blowing away India's top half to leave them at 5/3 and then 24/4. At that point, a huge win seemed likely but India did fight gradually. First through Pant-Hardik and then through a fantastic Jadeja-Dhoni partnership. The spinning all-rounder in particular played arguably his best ODI knock to get India really deep, with the experienced Dhoni at the other end. Things got really close but Jadeja's dismissal got NZ in front and then Guptill produced a moment for the ages, by running out MS in what could be the latter's final ODI. That was the final nail on the coffin for India who fell short in the end."

Boult to Dhoni, 1 run," slower ball around off, jabbed towards the gap at extra cover for a single. 100-run stand! What a partnership this has been! From nowhere, India are now very much in this game. MS and Jadeja shake hands but know that it's not over yet"

Neesham to Jadeja, no run, just short of short fine leg! Was in the air for a long time but Taylor couldn't get to it. Probably was late to pick it up initially and then couldn't reach it in time.

Neesham to Jadeja, 2 runs," fuller and on leg stump, Jadeja wrists it wide of long-on and they run hard once again to sneak the second"
Equation: 69 needed off 42! India steadily catching up in this game but it's still New Zealand who are in charge. At what point will the Kiwis feel the heat?

Needs to continue though as this game is still in NZ's bag for now"
Neesham to Jadeja, FOUR," blasted away! This is perhaps the best I have seen Jadeja bat in a limited-overs game for a long, long time and what a time to put on a show.

Santner to Jadeja, no run," moves around in the crease a bit as Santner fires it in on middle, knocked onto the pitch"
Santner to Jadeja, SIX," what a blow! Jadeja certainly seems in the mood and if his bowling/fielding form in the game are anything to go by, this game ain't over yet.

10:52 Local Time, 15:22 IST," 9:52PM NZST: 28 runs, 23 balls, and 3 wickets. An brief-but-eventful session of play, and despite never having to enter the 30-yard circle, it was Ravindra Jadeja who stole the show. A fabulous throw to get rid of Taylor, who could have made a serious difference to the total at the death, and another catch in the deep off the very next ball. However, the buzz-word of this morning was ""pace off"" - how difficult will it be for the Indians to bat? This is a below-par total, but in a World Cup knock-out, nothing is below par. India have the upper hand, but not by much. We'll be back in 10 minutes for the run-chase..."
Bumrah to Santner, leg byes," 1 run, fuller length delivery, lots of pace on it, 143km/h, Santner tries to hoick it into the on-side, gets it off the pads towards short third man for a single. That's that- NZ set India 240 to win in 2019's first World Cup semi-final"

Bumrah to Boult, no run," one short for the over, 134km/h angling right in towards his head, and it soars over his attempted hook"
Bumrah to Santner, 1 run," a third full-toss by Bumrah, who's been erring with the yorkers today, and that's swatted away to long-on for a single. Pace completely off - 99.6km/h. Nothing to play with."
Bhuvneshwar to Santner, 1 run," short one on the body, no pace, and that's a better line, and that's a delayed pull away to deep mid-wicket for a single"

Bhuvneshwar to Latham, 1 run," another inch-perfect yorker length, dug out from the crease to short cover for a quick single. Some interception between the batsman and Bhuvi, who collects the ball and mocks a throw at the non-striker's end - because there's no one backing up"
Bhuvneshwar to Latham, 2 runs," fuller length delivery on the pads, whipped away to backward square leg for a single - no wait - a couple! A poor throw from DK in the deep, and some lousy movement too"

""People on plans not flexible were requested to donate their tickets to the local cricket communities via boxes placed outside the exit gates yesterday.""", 09:28 GMT," 14:58 IST: India run into the field to bowl 23 balls, after a 20-and-a-half-hour delay. 11 from Bhuvneshwar, 12 from Bumrah.

18:22 Local Time, 17:22 GMT," 22:52 IST: Day 1, Stumps. You know it. You better know it. Okay, here's the spoonfeed -- play abandoned for the day. So here's how tomorrow will be - New Zealand will be out batting again at 10:30 local | 15:00 IST. They'll have 23 balls. India will then have the full 50 overs to hunt down the 211 + whatever to progress. Also, also, again, in case the spoilsport aka the rain returns, we'll keep waiting all day before the DLS thing kicks in to have at least a 20-over contest. Plus, in case tomorrow turns into a today (as in things don't allow a match), India will go through to the finals on account of finishing at a higher spot in the league."
18:16 Local Time, 17:16 GMT," 22:46 IST: The loop gets longer. Stop the switch case .. for now, output: It's raining. More covers. The umps are out there on an inspection, somebody, please bug them."
18:09 Local Time, 17:09 GMT," 22:39 IST: The three umpires are out there with Nigel Llong having a long chat by the pitch. The square does look a little damp, the super-soppers have been banished to man the boundaries, but for some reason, the officials don't seem to be doing the obvious. Anyway, in case it tells you something, Kohli is sitting in his official match gear."
17:51 Local Time, 16:51 GMT," 22:21 IST: Okay, it's raining again. The covers are back. You've been seeing it all along, you better get the trend. Also, in other totally unrelated stuff, cancel your plans for tomorrow. Start the countdown .."
17:46 Local Time, 16:46 GMT," 22:16 IST: It's all down to that one final inspection -- 18:10 UKT we're being told, which is something around 20-25 minutes from now. The pitch hover-cover is taken off. Okay, brace up .."
17:29 Local Time, 16:29 GMT," 21:59 IST: Trust a Kaushik update to bring in good news, ""Both super soppers now on duty as a second cover comes off. But there are massive puddles underneath."" The rain has stopped. Yes, yes, there's nothing wrong with your eyes, it's true. Also, if Google's weather is to be trusted, there's no further rain predicted today, which now brings everything down to Manchester's drainage."
17:26 Local Time, 16:26 GMT," 21:56 IST: There's no news. It's just the rain in bits and pieces. And there's no debate about this, nobody likes it! The rain seems to have eased off a bit though, and the groundsmen are out there, peeling off the layers in inspection."
17:05 Local Time, 16:05 GMT," 21:35 IST: We're told every effort will be made to finish things off today .. if only, if only someone could turn that damn tap off."
17:00 Local Time, 16:00 GMT," 21:30 IST: Rain has gotten heavier, Kaushik pings. I reckon the officials might just decide to defer this game to tomorrow with New Zealand finishing their innings and set-up an Indian chase. Despite the two-hour extension, we needed this game to end by 8 PM. Assuming a 20-over chase, India's innings must start in the region around 6:30 and the staff need at least an hour to get the ground ready, we might be close to pushing this game to tomorrow."
16:40 Local Time, 15:40 GMT, 21:10 IST: We have had some live pictures and it's still drizzling although the conditions look a lot brighter.
16:32 Local Time, 15:32 GMT, 21:02 IST: We have officially started losing overs if there is a resumption today. We will lose one over for every four minutes.
16:25 Local Time, 15:25 GMT," 20:55 IST: 'The sun's out now', pings Kaushik. 'But there's a slight drizzle. So no activity on covers as yet', he adds."
16:10 Local Time, 15:10 GMT," 20:40 IST: Rain has got a bit heavier, pings Kaushik. Fair to say, if play resumes tonight, New Zealand's innings is pretty much done with"
16:00 Local Time, 15:00 GMT," 20:30 IST: Right, the rain has gotten lighter and it's a lot more brighter. The super-soppers are doing their work. We will start losing overs from 4:31 pm local"
15:30 Local Time, 14:30 GMT," 20:00 IST: We could be in for a long long day. Here's what playing conditions rule 13.8.2 state: The ICC Match Referee is able to add a further 1 hour of Additional Extra Time (in addition to the 2 hours of extra time already available), if he/she believes that a result (see clause 16.1.1) can no longer be obtained on that day, even after using the available extra time and reducing the number of overs to be played, and that the application of the Additional Extra Time will increase the likelihood of obtaining a result on that day. For clarity, this additional extra time may also be used to allow for the completion of the Super Over. Basically, it means we could have a 20-over chase by India starting at midnight (Indian time) if the match referee deems the game could be completed today. In such a scenario, India's target would be 148"
15:15 Local Time, 14:15 GMT, 19:45 IST: It is still raining and two super soppers have been deployed to remove the excess water from the covers. The forecast says the wet weather might continue at least until 6 PM. It's then in the hands of the match referee to make a call on resuming play today (assuming rain stops).
15:05 Local Time, 14:05 GMT," 19:35 IST: It is still raining, but if you're still confused about the bits and pieces of the game, here's some detailed analysis. 'The scorer says the match referee will take a call on if he feels a 20-over chase is possible for India. So roughly they'll need about 80 minutes for it (take 1.5 hours as the ceiling) It is understood that the referee will try to do everything possible to try and get a result today. If the referee makes a call to reduce it to 20 overs a game and they're not able to, when it resumes tomorrow it'll still be a 20 over chase'"
14:40 Local Time, 13:40 GMT," 19:10 IST: This is long odds, but if New Zealand don't bat any further and India were to be set a 46-over chase, the target will be 237"
14:30 Local Time, 13:30 GMT," 19:00 IST: Rain has gotten heavier, reckons Kaushik, from the ground. A moment later, he says it's pelting down. Might be a long day for them and a long night for us. We will start losing overs only from 4 PM local time"
14:05 Local Time, 13:05 GMT," 18:35 IST: The entire square has now been covered. It isn't raining heavily, but it's enough to keep everyone in the shade. The ground-staff are pulling in more covers to cover the bowler's run-up and the entire inner square, on both sides of the wicket."
14:01 Local Time, 13:01 GMT," 18:31 IST: The rain has become heavier and the umpires have had enough. So, off they go with 23 balls still remaining. With this being a semis clash, the rules stipulate that we can wait for as many as two hours before starting to lose overs. The forecast was some afternoon showers and here they are. Play stopped due to rain"

Bhuvneshwar to Ross Taylor, no run," Ross Taylor has been given out LBW and he wants a review. Don't think he has bat on this, where was the impact?

13:40 Local Time, 00:40 GMT," 06:10 IST: These are tiny boundaries, and England have won themselves an important toss. Also, this is the first T20I to be played at the Hagley Oval, so you never really know with the pitch. Or do you? Well, this is New Zealand. It's got to be a belter."
Teams:, 00:40 GMT," 06:10 IST: These are tiny boundaries, and England have won themselves an important toss. Also, this is the first T20I to be played at the Hagley Oval, so you never really know with the pitch. Or do you? Well, this is New Zealand. It's got to be a belter."
For a change, everybody," everybody you can think of suddenly cares about T20Is. In fact all they care about are T20Is. So much so that England have started their 2015 version of marking out their journey to the cup. So, here are the debut camps being distributed -- Lewis Gregory, Sam Curran and Pat Brown have one each for themselves. "
12:20 local: Hello, hello. So," you've forgiven the World Cup? You've forgiven the super-over rules? You've forgiven umpire Dharmasena? You've forgiven that fateful night in July? No? Great. Here, the newest, and surely the most politest rivalry in cricket has a take two. The official champs versus those who deserved at least a part share. Brace up .. "
17:21 Local Time, 04:21 GMT," 09:51 IST: So New Zealand at Christchurch wanted only three things from their players - to bat, bowl and field better. Simple, right. Surely if you are the Kiwis. They've turned around a scratchy morning from a couple of days ago into an absolutely clinical one here. 177 didn't really look enough, a mic-ed up Tim Siefert in his chat during the innings too felt they were a few short. But, but, the first two overs in the chase sealed it. Bairstow fell, Vince compounded his miseries on what was already a pretty awful day for him, and soon after Morgan too fell after he looked like he was timing them well. Apart from that Sodhi over where Chris Jordan really laid into him, this was a pretty dead chase. The scorecard and a 21-run defeat does do justice. Okay, here come the presentations .."
Daryl Mitchell to Patrick Brown, 1 run," yorker, gets enough bat to drill it down the ground"

15:41 Local Time, 02:41 GMT," 08:11 IST: England will be the happier side in the innings break. Guptill got going today and at that point, 180 plus was looking a certainity. But Rashid dismissed him when he was looking threatening and his dimsissal acted as a speed breaker in New Zealand's innings. They kept losing wickets at regular intervals and couldn't find the momentum they would have liked, until Neesham came to the crease. The southpaw was brilliant in the death overs, his blitzkrieg enabled the hosts to reach 176. The score could have easily crossed 185 if Jordan wouldn't have bowled an exceptional spell in the slog overs. Neesham reckons the deck isn't a road and if that is the case, we have a second innings to look forward to. Join us in 10."

So, 2-1 then," eh. Also, let's not forget this England side is without six of their their regular starters. New Zealand are without two. But still, in what's a massive testament to their cricketing prowess in this format, they've been churning out cricket of the highest order here. We'll leave you with that for now, as I, Vineet Anantharaman, sign off on behalf of Abhinand Raghavendran, Pradeep Krishnamurthy and our scorer, Praveen. Until Napier, and a 2-2 for Auckland's sake, ta ta!!"
Tim Southee | Winning skipper: We showed as a group that it was going to get tough if we kept taking wickets. It was always going to be tough to hit from ball one. As long as Morgan was there they always were going to have a sniff. Colin has kicked on for us from Sri Lanka. He is a great team man and he is striking it really well; nice to see him kick on and get a big score. There are still a few areas we need to work on. It could have gone either way at the half way stage in the second innings., 2-1 then," eh. Also, let's not forget this England side is without six of their their regular starters.

Until Napier, and a 2-2 for Auckland's sake, ta ta!!"
Eoin Morgan | Losing skipper: It was one that got away from us. I thought we were in control all through the chase until we were three or four down. The lack of experience in the chase cost us. The guys coming in need to play a few more games to get that experience. It's great how competitive the series has been thus far. We are trying to integrate everybody into the squad. But certainly we feel that it's one that slipped away. Our gameplan remains the same; every thing about what we do is positive, smart," aggressive cricket. We want young guys to come in and adapt to that. A lot of positives to take away for us from today. A must win game for us as we move to Napier. An experienced Tom Curran in the end with the ball was brilliant, Sam has gone from strength to strength for us. He took the new ball for us and has been a massive positive."
17:19 Local Time, 04:19 GMT," 09:49 IST: It was clearly England's. At 139/2 with Morgan just having smacked Santner for a couple of sixes and an asking rate of only around eight-an-over in the last five, it was obviously England's. But they've been choked, courtesy some exemplary death bowling. Southee came in for the 16th, squeezed in a three-run, one-wicket over. The one-match-old Tickner came on for the 17th, killed it further with Vince's wicket and a five-run over. Ferguson, and his thunderbolts, testified the burial in the 18th. But again, as much as you'd want to believe this was won at the death, it was the Kiwi batting, the age-old strategy of piling on first innings runs that was the clincher. Anyway, here come the presentations .."

England's players to make their T20I debut this series - Lewis Gregory, Sam Curran, Patrick Brown, Saqib Mahmood, Banton and Parkinson. While the 50-overs World Champions are experimenting with their combination, their opponents are eyeing consistency with their experienced players. Hang around for toss and team updates."
13:00 Local Time, 00:00 GMT," 05:30 IST: It's 1-1 in the 5-match T20I series after a convincing win for the hosts at the Cake Tin, Wellington. The visitors didn't help their cause one bit with their poor fielding and several dropped catches, with James Vince being the main culprit. Chasing 177, they never really got going and if not for Chris Jordan's blows towards the end, they would have probably fallen well short of the target. That has set up the series nicely as we reach the third game in Nelson. "

18:02 Local Time, 16:02 GMT," 21:32 IST: Root politely asks for a 30-minute extension, gets turned down, and walks away. Not to be. Stumps. He'll lead his side out, basking in the newfound glory of his four-fer. So 2-1 is almost England's, and all they'll be fighting tomorrow is the rain. Because the South African refuse to fight. Quite like where things were left yesterday, it was down to their tail to wag in hope of them being able to claw out a draw here.

11:36 Local Time, 09:36 GMT," 15:06 IST: Seems like the rain has stopped. The covers are coming off. However, it continues to be quite murky."
11:10 Local Time, 09:10 GMT," 14:40 IST: The rain is extremely heavy at the moment and our man at the ground Telford tells us that this is the heaviest it's been in this game so far. However, the plus point is that a strong wind is also blowing across the ground, which could take the rains away with it at some point."
11:02 Local Time, 09:02 GMT," 14:32 IST: The drizzle has gotten heavy and the umpires feel that enough is enough. They're going off. Persistent showers at the moment, not extremely heavy though, still enough to keep the players off the park. Any delay is welcome for the Proteas. On the other hand, England will be frustrated at these breaks."

10:27 Local Time: The follow-on is enforced. 27 minutes, 28 balls," four wickets and one whole run -- that's how brutal it's been. And a nice slap in the face for all those who thought South Africa would slog it out to ensure they aren't made to follow on. Oh slog they did, T20-like, ones completely uncalled for. So Dom Bess will take the ball and lead his side out, although it was the older ball with which he picked all those wickets. Nevertheless. The conditions are overcast, the ball will be newer and the South African batsmen clearly have been given a rude wake up call, a couple of hours earlier than they'd have expected."

18:01 Local Time, 16:01 GMT," 21:31 IST | Stumps: It started. It stopped. It started. It kept threatening to stop - drizzle, dipping lights, fast bowlers - but no, England have found a way to squeeze in all their overs. And it needed a spin marathon towards the end and having to use up a part-timer. But they'll be proud of what they've achieved. On a wicket that didn't turn much and where taking wickets was the real challenge (ask Nortje, the batsman), Dom Bess started off superbly in the first session, teaming up with Mark Wood in particular who continued softening up the batsmen from one end while he kept getting the rewards. South Africa fought hard, Quinton stayed resolute, Nortje kept getting hit, but stayed alive for 136 balls. Things could've been worse though. If only Ben Stokes had held on .. Anyway, it sets things up perfectly for tomorrow, with the weather too set to play a big part in this Test's outcome. Until we see you then, ta ta!!"

16:19 Local Time, 14:19 GMT," 19:49 IST: The visitors finish off with a mammoth first innings score of 499/9. On the back of the centuries by Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope, England have posted a commanding total. There were contributions right throughout the innings with Wood entertaining us towards the end. But, Pope has to be the man of the moment. The 22-year-old notched up his maiden Test century and as a result of that, England have South Africa by the scruff of their neck. Going to be tough for South Africa to bounce back from this situation. So, it's going to be interesting to see their approach for the next hour-and-a-half. Will the English bowlers manage to put them under the cosh? We'll be back in 5 to find that out.."

12:47 Local Time, 10:47 GMT," 16:17 IST: A session dominated by England! The fifth-wicket partnership on 186* between Stokes and Pope has put the visitors in a commanding position. England scored runs at a snail's pace yesterday, but they were pretty brisk with the scoring rate today, especially that man - Ben Stokes. The English all-rounder notched up his 9th Test ton and also became the second English all-rounder to achieve the double of 4000-plus Test runs and 100-plus wickets in the format. Pope was given out by Bruce Oxenford, but the young batsman used DRS to overturn that decision against him. England will look to overhaul the 450-run mark in the post-lunch session.

17:25 Local Time, 15:25 GMT," 20:55 IST: An old-fashioned day of Test cricket and at the end of it, things are rather even. South Africa were on top when they had Root early in the final session but Stokes and Pope stitched a fluent unbeaten half-century stand to see the day through. Both batsmen had their moments of fortune but dug in, and blunted the hosts' bowlers. Right from the openers, all the England batsmen got starts (without converting), albeit at a very slow pace due to the conditions and South Africa's disciplined bowlers. Maharaj was the pick of the bowlers as he got some purchase from the pitch. The others were decent but it was baffling to see Faf not give Rabada both the new balls. Still, the hosts were quite competitive and didn't let England off the hook. The second new ball is still fresh and tomorrow morning could be an interesting sub-plot. Do join us for the second day's play. Until next time, it's goodbye."

Maharaj to Stokes, no run," review for a catch! That's the second review taken by South Africa against Stokes. How desperate are they for this wicket?

Rabada to Denly, FOUR," shot of confidence! Denly needs to thank the bowler though. Rabada provides him with a short and wide ball outside off, Joe Denly hops in his crease and plays an aerial square cut. No fielder at deep point and that'll be a boundary for England's number 3"

14:42 Local Time, 12:42 GMT," 18:12 IST -- Tea: Yay, the run-rate's managed to stay at over 2/over. It was a throwback to the days when counting balls wasn't the norm. So the plan from the South African pacers was quite clear in this session -- to bowl on the pads with a leg-trap around. Rabada got Sibley to walk into it. Nortje got Crawley to walk into it. Joe Root's been rather scratchy, playing a few too many shots for this slow pitch's liking. But that's how run-scoring on this pitch is bound to be, ugly-looking. Yes, it's that slow. It tells you a story when even flicks off the pads aren't controlled. Anyway, we'll be back soon, 20 .."

12:02 Local Time, 10:02 GMT," 15:32 IST: So the first session of T03D01 goes to England. Root's decision to bat first has worked in favour of the visitors. The pitch behaved really slow throughout the session, but the English openers adjusted well to the conditions. Crawley played a couple of rash shots, but luckily for him, the ball dropped in no man's land on both occasions. Faf du Plessis has tried out all his bowlers, but none of them have looked threatening enough to take a wicket. The last time England stitched a 100-run stand was way back in December 2016, and looking at the way Crawley and Sibley have batted, they might be able to overhaul the 100-run mark in the post-lunch session. So, join us in 40 minutes for the next session."

17:10 Local Time, 15:10 GMT," 20:40 IST: Stokes's Test! The omnipotent Stokes just continues to extend his legends. Umpteen Odes to this man's tenacity and talent will fall short. He was fighting fatigue and an unresponsive pitch. But six catches, a quick-fire 72 and now three wickets towards the end. This man writes his own inimitable scripts. SA can hold their heads high though. They dragged England to the very brink. They almost got a stalemate only to be checkmated by Ben Stokes. One bad move from Philander of denying the single towards the end had Pretorius facing Stokes, who was breathing fire. Now, take your minds back to that 47-ball 72 from Stokes. That gave England cushion of runs and time. Both the teams fought a tooth and nail battle for different results and in the end, it was England who have come out on top. The fight for survival in the end fell short in comparison to the zeal for a win. Hang on for the presentations."

15:12 Local Time, 13:12 GMT," 18:42 IST: Another testing session for the hosts has come to an end. QDK and RVD have displayed some wonderful technique and mental resolve to hang in there. The usually fluent QDK has brought about a water-tight technique which has been difficult to breach through. Anderson didn't bowl at all in the session and that is certainly not good news for England. Stokes, the lion heart that he is, gave it his all but was unable to break through the defences. He tried volleying a few words at RVD too but even that was consumed like all the deliveries that he has been dead-batting. The spinners tried a ploy of bowling it full but that also didn't work. The wicket is still playing well and SA would look for a stalemate. But do England have a few moves left? We shall see!"

12:33 Local Time, 10:33 GMT," 16:03 IST: England nipped out the nightwatchman early in the day and the duo of Pieter Malan and Faf du Plessis did well to see off the probing spell from Anderson. However, the South African skipper - whom you'd pick most of the days in your team to bat out a day - played an aggressive sweep shot and perished with less than 25 balls to go for the second new ball. The debutant - Malan - has been rock solid and hasn't shown any signs of tentativeness against whatever has been thrown at him. He's just 17 runs away from his maiden Test century. But, there's a bigger goal. Two more sessions to block and the series scoreline will remain 1-0. England, on the other hand, have a 3-over-old new ball with them and will give their all to scalp the remaining six wickets. This Test has all the ingredients to turn into a thriller. Join us in 40 minutes for the middle session."

The bowler was ball-watching and took a few steps back, meaning Faf had to take the longer route to avoid him and even barged his right elbow into Anderson. Faf didn't like that.

17:54 Local Time, 15:54 GMT," 21:24 IST: SA are still alive in this game and they have worked really hard to ensure England flex their muscles. Earlier, Stokes decimated the hosts and ensured England rained runs in the first session. They declared early in the second session and England have strived hard to pick up wickets after that. The runs have been kept at a check. But the hosts have managed to blunt out 56 overs for the loss of only two wickets. Elgar was a little unlucky and Hamza was prised out by Anderson. Pieter Malan has looked like a veteran in his maiden Test and things for a change aren't looking as gloomy for SA as it did when the day started off. The wicket still doesn't have any demons on it and batting shouldn't too different to what it was on day 4. 90 overs, 312 runs, 8 wickets. The numbers game will continue on day 5. We shall be there to get you all the action."

15:11 Local Time, 13:11 GMT," 18:41 IST: Tea, Day 4: The Proteas dressing room is much more positive now, with Elgar and Malan showing resistance. England were patient and consistent with their lines, but the early Bess experiment didn't work to Elgar. Denly though started to trouble with his leg spin out of the rough.

12:31 Local Time, 10:31 GMT," 16:01 IST: 421 runs as a lead, do I need to say more? England have a vice-like grip over their opponents. Of course, Sibley had his moment under the sun courtesy his maiden ton. But the stage was lit up by Ben Stokes. He came, he entertained (the crowd), he conquered (the bowling atatck). His 47-ball 72 handed England more game time and a declaration at the other side of the break might well be a reality. A few balls did misbehave but the divots and craters are still pretty dormant in nature. It is still a decent wicket to bat on but SA have a daunting task ahead. Come back in half an hour."

Gets to the landmark with a hard sweep to one that was outside leg, pounded it away through backward square leg and immediately let out a roar of delight. England have had problems with their openers in recent years but this bloke does seem like he can solve that for them.

18:02 Local Time, 16:02 GMT, 21:32 IST: The wicket of Bess off the last ball might have been a dampener on a day which belonged to England. They owned the entire day and own the Test now if you ask me. The visitors are all over the Proteas like a rash. And seems to be an unending one that too. They hardly took a few minutes to roll the hosts out and get a lead worth 46. Post that the wicket eased out a little and the England batters did well to take advantage of it. Zak Crawley and Joe Denly did well to get starts but that never took off. But Sibley and Root added 116 runs for the third wicket to ensure SA remained on the back foot. Another Root fifty didn't quite transform into a triple digit score but Sibley might as well bring up the first ton of the series and of his career as well. Day 4 promises more riveting stuff. Come back tomorrow!

Welcome back. The final session witnessed the fall of five wickets yesterday. South Africa will be hoping for something similar. England, meanwhile, will look to consolidate their lead. The SA players disperse from a huddle. KG to start proceedings with a slip in place
15:11 Local Time, 13:11 GMT," 18:41 IST: Tea, Day 3 - England strengthen their position. It was pretty boring for most parts of the session with no intensity from South Africa and the England batsmen happy to bide time. Nortje injected some life with a fiery short ball that got Denly. Sibley has shown his fighting temperament. He's occupied the crease to frustrate the bowlers. A good final session will put England in a commanding position. A poor finish today could well be curtains in the game for South Africa. The pitch is still pretty good for batting, but it is assisting the bowlers if they turn the heat up. We will be back with the action in 20 minutes."

James Anderson was on a hat-trick after the first ball of the day. He then completed his 28th fifer to give England a 46-run lead. South Africa were mentally down with the deficit. It showed in their bowling. They were hitting the strides, but Rabada did manage to trouble Sibley. He eventually got Crawley with a well thought out outswinger.

15:11 Local Time, 13:11 GMT," 18:41 IST: South Africa would have had a nervy lunch, but they'll be more relaxed now. A wicketless session where the home team added 81 runs in 30 overs. Trust me, batting isn't that easy and it wasn't pedestrian bowling either. Elgar is doing what he does the best and Rassie van der Dussen - playing his second Test - tried to follow suit. Broad started from Wynberg End and managed to nick out RVDD, but he had overstepped. That's been another talking point this session. As many as 12 no-balls weren't called post lunch. The second half of the middle session saw Anderson come into the attack and he hardly offered any freebies. He should have had Rassie, but Stokes put down a tough chance in the cordon. The deficit is 128 and South Africa should fancy their chances to take the lead. Will we see a twist? Join us in 20 minutes for the final session.."

12:32 Local Time, 10:32 GMT," 16:02 IST: Lunch, Day 1 - The hosts will walk back happier. Commendable over-rate from South Africa. England would have wanted a better reading of the scorecard after opting to bat first. Not much of grass on this Newlands surface to excite the pacers, but the South Africans did get some seam movement bowling tight lines. Philander was probing as usual and he fittingly got the first breakthrough. Denly and Sibley saw off some tough bowling spells, but Rabada came back to get the latter. Massive credit to Pretorius for holding one end tight with his consistent nip-backers from good length. Nortje bowled with pace and we should see him use the short ball ploy better in the second session. The Proteas are in a great mind space with a Test victory and a good start here. England's mental strength to be put to test again. Join us back in about 40 minutes for the resumption."

12:01 Local Time, 10:01 GMT," 15:31 IST -- Lunch: The morning session has been a game of patience. Philander and Rabada started it by probing away in the channel around off-stump and giving nothing way.

09:30 Local Time, 07:30 GMT," 13:00 IST -- Day 3: England and batting collapses go hand in hand in Test cricket. They generally have at least one capitulation in every series and they picked yesterday to have one - going perfectly well at 142 for 3 with Denly on 50 and Stokes looking set, they lost 7 wickets for 39 runs from there and were bowled out for 181, handing a lead of 103. Credit to the South African bowlers as well who were more disciplined on a surface that had enough help. Vernon Philander put on a masterclass of seam and swing bowling as he not only held one end up with precision bowling but also made surgical strikes in between. Rabada and Nortje bowled fast and got variable bounce, while Pretorius did a Philander like a job - it was a complete team effort to restrict England."
17:33 Local Time, 15:33 GMT," 21:03 IST -- Stumps: The two batsmen speak to the umpires as they walk off and it might have been for the uncalled no-ball. The England players also slowly trudge off the field. And before we get into what happened in the day's play let us focus on the overrate. We lost over 7 overs yesterday and 10 today, that is over an hour's play lost for the viewers. Yes, the conditions are humid and some of the players are carrying a flu but even with the additional 30 minutes both teams are not able to bowl the full quota of 90 overs. The match referee will need to have a word with both the captains regarding this."

Jofra Archer to Nortje, no run, and another.. But the umpire does not think so. South African batsmen want Archer out of the attack.

Not sure how though as the side on replays clearly show it was over stump height. Archer is lucky that he isn't banned from bowling
Jofra Archer to Nortje, no ball," oh no! The knuckle ball slips out of Archer's hand and ends up as beamer. Nortje was ducking for his life. With the light fading it is hard to spot the usual deliveries but one that doesn't bounce is even more so, luckily for him it was over the stumps"
